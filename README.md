# Financial News Sentiment Analysis & Knowledge Graph

Problem Statement:
Financial news contains valuable insights that can influence investment and business decisions, but manually extracting sentiment and understanding relationships between entities is time-consuming. 
This project automates sentiment classification and builds an interactive Knowledge Graph to efficiently explore entities and their related news.

This project combines **financial news sentiment analysis** with **graph-based information retrieval**, providing an interactive system for exploring relationships between entities and related news records.

## 🔹 Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis & Sentiment Classification:**  
  - Performed EDA on **5,842 financial news records**.  
  - Classified news as **positive, negative, or neutral** using **NLTK** for preprocessing and **TF-IDF** vectorization.  
  - Trained models like **Logistic Regression**, **Linear SVC**, **Random Forest**, and **Naive Bayes** with **Stratified K-Fold cross-validation**, achieving **70% accuracy** and **0.71 F1-score** (best with Logistic Regression).

- **Deep Learning Sentiment Classifiers:**  
  - Built **LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and GRU** classifiers using **Word2Vec embeddings (gensim)**.  
  - Incorporated **Dropout layers** and **Keras callbacks** to prevent overfitting.  
  - **Bi-LSTM achieved the best performance: 72% accuracy.**

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER) & Knowledge Graph:**  
  - Extracted entities using **spaCy**.  
  - Constructed a **Knowledge Graph** in a **Dockerized Neo4j** container.  
  - Interactive **Streamlit frontend** allows users to query entities: for each query, the relevant subgraph is generated using **Cypher**, and corresponding news records are retrieved.

- **Neo4j + Cypher** for graph database  
- **Docker** for Neo4j containerization  
- **Streamlit** for interactive frontend  
- **PyVis** for graph visualization  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data handling
